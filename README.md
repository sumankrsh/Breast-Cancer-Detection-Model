# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model
we can train machines to detect objects in images, extract meaning from text, stop spam emails, drive cars, discover new drug candidates, and beat top players in Chess, Go, and countless other games and most of the credit goes to deep-learning.  Machine doesn't understands the science/theory, all it does is generalises the ideas by visiting a lot of data, so lacking a perfect theory we have to rely on intutions. Deeper Neural Network because it generalises more and overfits less.  So, even if part of the face is hidden, the network will still pick up a signal from the remaining input, and therefore generalize better. It's a good intuition, and it appears to be what is actually happening. Experiments confirm that deep neural networks outperform shallow ones on common image as well as text tasks.
